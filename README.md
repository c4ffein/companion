# Companion

A minimal, single-file Python tool for ephemeral file sharing on local networks. Share files seamlessly between your devices - your phone, TV, laptop, and more.

## Features

- **Single file**: Just `companion.py` - easy to audit and deploy, works as both server and client
- **Zero dependencies**: Python 3.7+ standard library only
- **In-memory storage**: Ephemeral by design - files disappear on restart
- **API key auth**: Simple Bearer token authentication for allowing uploads
- **Web interface**: Clean, responsive UI with tab navigation and auto-refresh
- **File preview**: Preview images, videos, audio, PDFs, and text files in-browser
- **Presentation mode**: Control what all clients see from the CLI
- **CLI client**: Upload files, list files, and control previews from command line
- **Tested**: Comprehensive E2E test suite included

## Quick Start

### Start Server

```bash
# Default: http://localhost:8080
python companion.py server --api-key mySecretKey123

# Custom port and API key
python companion.py server --port 9000 --api-key mySecretKey123
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the web interface.

### Upload Files

**Via Web Interface:**
1. Open the server URL in your browser
2. Enter your API key
3. Select a file and click Upload

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
# Upload a file
python companion.py upload http://localhost:8080 myfile.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123

# Upload and automatically set as preview for all clients
python companion.py upload http://localhost:8080 slides.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123 --set-preview
```

### List Files

```bash
# List all available files
python companion.py list http://localhost:8080
```

### Control Presentation Mode

```bash
# Set what all connected clients see
python companion.py set-preview http://localhost:8080 slides.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123
```

## Use Cases

- **Local network file transfer**: Share files between devices on the same network
- **Quick demos**: Temporarily share files during presentations
- **Development**: Test file uploads/downloads in your application
- **Air-gapped environments**: No internet required
- **Privacy-focused**: Files never leave your network

## Installation

No installation needed! Just download the built `companion.py` (includes inlined PDF.js for offline use):

```bash
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/c4ffein/companion/master/companion.py
chmod +x companion.py
```

Or clone the repository for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/c4ffein/companion.git
cd companion
# Use src/companion.py for development (requires internet for PDF preview)
# Or run 'make build' to create companion.py at root with inlined PDF.js
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
make test  # Run all tests
python test_companion.py  # Or directly with Python
```

### Code Quality

```bash
make format  # Format code
make lint    # Lint code
make check   # Run all checks
```

### Project Structure

```
companion/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ companion.py      # Development version (uses CDN for PDF.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ js_deps/              # JavaScript dependencies cache
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf.min.mjs       # PDF.js library (auto-downloaded)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pdf.worker.min.mjs # PDF.js worker (auto-downloaded)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ companion.py          # Built version (generated, includes inlined PDF.js)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build.py              # Build tool to create companion.py from src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_companion.py     # Test suite
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Makefile              # Build commands
```

### Building for Distribution

The repository uses a two-version approach:

- **Development**: `src/companion.py` uses CDN-hosted PDF.js (requires internet for PDF preview)
- **Distribution**: `companion.py` at root includes inlined PDF.js (~1.5MB, works offline)

To build the distribution version:

```bash
make build  # Creates companion.py at root with inlined PDF.js
```

The build process:
1. Reads `src/companion.py`
2. Fetches PDF.js (~400KB) and PDF.js Worker (~1MB) from CDN (or uses cached versions in `js_deps/`)
3. Inlines them into the Python source as JavaScript strings
4. Adds a marker to the docstring indicating it's a built version
5. Writes `companion.py` to the root directory

**Notes:**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è Committing Generated Files**: Both `companion.py` (built file) and `js_deps/` (dependencies) are committed to git. This is intentionally against typical best practices, but is an acceptable tradeoff for this project
- The built file is automatically generated - don't edit it directly, edit `src/companion.py` instead
- JavaScript dependencies are cached in `js_deps/` for faster rebuilds
- First build downloads from CDN, subsequent builds use the cache
- To force re-download, delete files in `js_deps/`

## Security Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, this tool is designed for temporary, trusted, local network use only.**

- Files are stored in memory without encryption (E2E encryption planned for future)
- Uses simple Bearer token authentication
- No HTTPS support (use a reverse proxy if needed)
- No rate limiting or DOS protection
- Not intended for production or internet-facing deployments
- Only use on trusted networks with trusted users
