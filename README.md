# Companion

A minimal, single-file Python tool for ephemeral file sharing on local networks. Share files seamlessly between your devices - your phone, TV, laptop, and more.

## Features

- **Single file**: Just `companion.py` - easy to audit and deploy, works as both server and client
- **Zero dependencies**: Python 3.7+ standard library only
- **In-memory storage**: Ephemeral by design - files disappear on restart
- **API key auth**: Simple Bearer token authentication for allowing uploads
- **Web interface**: Clean, responsive UI with tab navigation and auto-refresh
- **File preview**: Preview images, videos, audio, PDFs, and text files in-browser
- **Presentation mode**: Control what all clients see from the CLI
- **CLI client**: Upload files, list files, and control previews from command line
- **Tested**: Comprehensive E2E test suite included

## Quick Start

### Start Server

```bash
# Default: http://localhost:8080
python companion.py server --api-key mySecretKey123

# Custom port and API key
python companion.py server --port 9000 --api-key mySecretKey123
```

Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser to see the web interface.

### Upload Files

**Via Web Interface:**
1. Open the server URL in your browser
2. Enter your API key
3. Select a file and click Upload

**Via Command Line:**
```bash
# Upload a file
python companion.py upload http://localhost:8080 myfile.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123

# Upload and automatically set as preview for all clients
python companion.py upload http://localhost:8080 slides.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123 --set-preview
```

### List Files

```bash
# List all available files
python companion.py list http://localhost:8080
```

### Control Presentation Mode

```bash
# Set what all connected clients see
python companion.py set-preview http://localhost:8080 slides.pdf --api-key mySecretKey123
```

## Use Cases

- **Local network file transfer**: Share files between devices on the same network
- **Quick demos**: Temporarily share files during presentations
- **Development**: Test file uploads/downloads in your application
- **Air-gapped environments**: No internet required
- **Privacy-focused**: Files never leave your network

## Security Notes

**‚ö†Ô∏è Currently, this tool is designed for temporary, trusted, local network use only.**

- Files are stored in memory without encryption (E2E encryption planned for future)
- Uses simple Bearer token authentication
- No HTTPS support (use a reverse proxy if needed)
- No rate limiting or DOS protection
- Not intended for production or internet-facing deployments
- Only use on trusted networks with trusted users
